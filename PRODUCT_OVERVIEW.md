# VentureAnalytica AI: Product Overview

## What does the product do today?

VentureAnalytica AI is a dual-purpose platform designed to streamline the venture capital investment process by connecting startup founders and VC analysts. It automates data collection, research, and the drafting of investment memos.

### For Venture Capital Analysts & Partners:

1.  **Report Creation**: Analysts can create investment reports for startups. They can either start a report from scratch for an "unregistered" company or, more powerfully, use the comprehensive data submitted by a "registered" company.

2.  **AI-Powered Data Collection (Stage 1)**:
    *   **Source Ingestion**: Analysts can add and manage various data sources for a company, including URLs, documents (pitch decks, financials), images, YouTube links, and pasted text.
    *   **Deep Research Agent**: An interactive AI chatbot, powered by Gemini Pro with Google Search, helps analysts conduct deep research. The agent suggests relevant research questions, asks clarifying questions to refine queries, and allows the full research conversation to be saved as a data source.
    *   **Founder Outreach Simulation**: Analysts can trigger simulated emails to founders, prompting them to complete the voice interview and behavioral assessment steps on the founder portal.

3.  **Automated Memo Generation (Stage 2)**:
    *   Based on the analyst's selected data sources, the platform uses a Gemini Pro model to automatically generate a comprehensive, multi-section investment memo draft.
    *   This initial draft can be downloaded as a PDF or a professional, multi-slide PowerPoint presentation. The PowerPoint generation is AI-enhanced, with Gemini analyzing the memo's content to automatically create relevant charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts for financials, pie charts for market share).

4.  **Iterative Memo Curation (Stage 3)**:
    *   Analysts can refine the initial AI-generated memo by providing specific curation instructions. They can adjust the memo's tone (Formal, Bullish), length (Concise, Detailed), add custom instructions, and fine-tune the weight and importance of over 15 distinct sections.
    *   The AI then rewrites the memo to these exact specifications. This curated version can also be downloaded as an AI-enhanced PowerPoint or PDF.

### For Startup Founders:

The platform provides a guided, three-step portal for founders to register their company and submit their data for investor evaluation.

1.  **Step 1: Company Information**: Founders fill out a form with their company's name, description, contact details, and can upload multiple relevant documents.

2.  **Step 2: Live Voice Interview**: Founders engage in a live, conversational interview with an AI agent. The AI, powered by Gemini and Text-to-Speech models, proactively asks a structured set of questions about the founder's background, vision, traction, and team. The system uses the browser's Speech Recognition for voice input, but also allows founders to type their responses or skip the interview. A real-time transcript is displayed during the conversation.

3.  **Step 3: Behavioral Assessment**: Founders complete a 20-question psychometric test designed to provide investors with qualitative insights into key traits like resilience, adaptability, and leadership.

Upon completion, all submitted data is automatically packaged into a report that becomes available to analysts on the platform.

## Who is it for?

The platform is designed for two key user groups in the venture capital ecosystem:

*   **Primary Users: Venture Capital Analysts and Partners**. The tool is built to augment their workflow, automate their most time-consuming tasks (research and memo drafting), and help them scale their deal flow analysis.
*   **Secondary Users: Startup Founders**. The platform serves as a structured and efficient data-submission portal for founders who are seeking investment, allowing them to present their company's information in a comprehensive, investor-friendly format.

## What is the main outcome for the user?
